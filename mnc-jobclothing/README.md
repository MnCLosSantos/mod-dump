# OR download ZIP from Releases
```

Place into your resources folder:
```
[server-data]/resources/[custom]/mnc-jobclothing/
```

### 2️⃣ Database Setup

The script **automatically creates** the required table on first start:

- `job_outfits` - Stores saved outfits with job, location, gender, data, icon, and min_grade

No manual SQL import needed!

### 3️⃣ Add to Server Config

```lua
# server.cfg
ensure oxmysql
ensure mnc-jobclothing
```

### 4️⃣ Configure Settings

Edit `config.lua` to customize:

```lua
-- Debug mode
Config.Debug = false

-- Progress style
Config.Progress = 'bar'  -- 'bar' or 'circle'

-- Notification duration
Config.DefaultNotifyTime = 5000

-- Zone size
Config.ZoneSize = { x = 2.0, y = 2.0 }

-- Locker room locations
Config.Locations = {
    {
        name = "autoexotics_clothing",
        label = "Auto Exotics Locker Room",
        coords = vector4(538.86, -166.17, 54.66, 185.45),
        job = "autoexotics",                 -- restrict to this job (set to nil for public)
        require_onduty = false,         -- must be on duty
        min_grade_to_use = 0,           -- minimum grade to open menu
        min_grade_to_add = 4,           -- minimum grade to save new outfits
    },
    -- Add more locations as needed
}
```

### 5️⃣ Add Items (Optional)

This script doesn't require new items, but you can add clothing-related items to `qb-core/shared/items.lua` if integrating with inventory systems.

## 🧪 System Mechanics

### Outfit Saving
1. **Capture Current Appearance**: Saves all 12 components and 5 props
2. **Database Storage**: Unique per job/location/gender/name
3. **Permission Check**: Requires min_grade_to_add
4. **Update Mode**: Overwrite data while keeping name/grade/icon
5. **Icon Selection**: Enhances menu visuals

### Access Controls
1. **Job Check**: Must match location.job (if set)
2. **Duty Check**: Must be on duty if require_onduty = true
3. **Grade Check**: Player grade >= min_grade_to_use to open menu
4. **Outfit Grade**: Player grade >= outfit.min_grade to wear

### Changing Process
1. **Progress Bar**: 5s for uniform, 4s for civilian
2. **Backup Original**: Stores current clothes before change
3. **Apply Outfit**: Sets components and props
4. **Cooldown**: 10s between changes
5. **Cancellation**: Stops progress and notifies

### Zone Management
1. **qb-target Zones**: Box zones at configured coords
2. **Dynamic Creation**: On script start
3. **Cleanup**: On resource stop

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Zones not appearing:**
- Ensure qb-target is started before mnc-jobclothing
- Check Config.Debug = true for poly visualization
- Verify coords in config.lua

**Outfits not saving:**
- Verify oxmysql is properly configured
- Check database connection in server console
- Confirm job_outfits table exists

**Menu not opening:**
- Check job/grade/duty requirements
- Verify player data sync with QBCore
- Look for client console errors

**Permissions denied:**
- Confirm player.job.name matches location.job
- Check player.job.grade.level >= required
- Verify on-duty status if required

**Legacy outfits not loading:**
- Ensure old format keys (tshirt, torso2, etc.) exist in data
- Script auto-detects and applies fallback
