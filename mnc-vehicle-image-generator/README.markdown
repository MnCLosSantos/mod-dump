## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Download & Extract

Place the resource in your resources folder:
```
[server-data]/resources/[custom]/mnc-vehicle-image-generator/
```

### 2️⃣ Add to Server Config

```lua
# server.cfg
ensure screenshot-basic
ensure mnc-vehicle-image-generator
```

### 3️⃣ Configure

Edit `config.lua`:

```lua
Config.DefaultWebhook = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...'

Config.CameraSettings = {
    coords = vector3(90.48, -2731.8, 6.0),
    heading = 290.2,
    cameraOffset = vector3(6.8, -4, 0.6),
    cameraRotation = vector3(176.6, -181.1, -118.5),
    fov = 71.5
}

Config.CaptureDelay = 1000
Config.ChunkSize = 25
```

### 4️⃣ Vehicle List

Use the in-game command:
```bash
/vehlist
```
This will generate `vehlist1.lua`, `vehlist2.lua`, etc. Copy the contents into `Config.VehicleSpawnCodes` in `config.lua`.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### VehicleSpawnCodes (config.lua)

```lua
Config.VehicleSpawnCodes = {
    'banshee3',
    'driftjester3',
    'polbuffalo6',
    -- ... up to 250 recommended per batch
}
```

### Camera Settings

All values are live-editable in the UI and can be saved permanently.

---

## 🎮 Usage

1. Type `/vehimage` or `/vehui` in chat
2. Paste your Discord webhook
3. Adjust camera settings (or use Preview)
4. Select vehicles (use **Select 250** for safety)
5. Set Chunk Size (25 recommended)
6. Click **Start Capture**

**Controls:**
- `ESC` – Close UI
- Drag logo to move window
- Resize from edges/corners
- Opacity slider in header

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Vehicle not appearing / black screen**
- Increase `Config.CaptureDelay`
- Make sure `screenshot-basic` is started before this resource

**Server crashing / freezing**
- Lower `Config.ChunkSize` (try 15–25)
- Never exceed 250 vehicles in one batch

**Images not saving**
- Check server console for errors
- Ensure resource has write permissions to `vehicle-images/` folder

**Webhook not working**
- Use the **Test** button in the UI
- Make sure the webhook has file upload permissions

**Model fails to load**
- Invalid spawn code or model not streamed
